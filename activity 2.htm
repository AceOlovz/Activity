<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> <b>W3SCHOOL</b></a>
<p style=color:green;> I put this here because i recommend this to students who's learning about the programming, it's help a lot and for studying and learning codes. i used this also beacuse teachers and my friend recommend this to me so i put it heare cause i think it's important. </p>.

<a href="https://www.google.com/"> <b> GOOGLE</b></a>
<p style=color:lightblue;> I add this cause it is the most used search engine of all people. And i also used this to get something like cracked files and search for some answers. Also it is the general site that appears when you open a browser and it is connected to almost all the site you might know or use. </p>.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/"> <b> FACEBOOK</b></a>
<p style=color:red;> Of course the Facebook is one of it, beacuse who doesn't know about this it is the most popular site that used all over the world. For chatting, watching movies, short videos, streaming and many more according to what purpose they want to use it.</p>.

<a href="https://www.instagram.com/"> <b> INSTAGRAM</b></a>
<p style=color:yellow;> Instagram, for me the use of this app is to show only pictures. What i want to this is the instagram didn't make the photos resolution low. You can enjoy what you capture, also the pictures of who you want to see is very clear. Having a good moments and memories like it happens yesterday because of it natural and original looks. </p>.

<a href="https://zoechip.org/"> <b> ZOECHIP</b></a>
<p> I love this site cause it make me enjoy the movies i want to watch even though i don't have any netflix subscription. It gives an updated movies on what netflix have and you don't need to pay for the monthly fee. The only cons is the site have ads but not that annoying, and the movie sometimes has a low quality resolution like what you called "pinirata" </p>.
